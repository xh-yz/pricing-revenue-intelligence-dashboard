# 💎 Supermarket Pricing & Revenue Intelligence Dashboard

This project is **not a sales report**.

It is a **Revenue Intelligence & Profit Leakage Detection system** designed to answer one critical business question:

> Where are we truly making money — and where are we silently losing it?

---

## 🚩 Business Problem

Traditional retail dashboards focus on:
- Total sales
- Units sold
- Revenue growth

However, these metrics often **hide profit leakages**, pricing anomalies, and inefficient campaigns.

This project reframes sales data into **profitability, pricing risk, and payment behavior intelligence**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Detect hidden profit loss caused by pricing anomalies  
- Analyze payment method impact on basket size  
- Simulate FX (USD/TRY) impact on margins  
- Identify campaigns that increase volume but reduce profitability  

---

## 🧠 Analytical Approach

### 1️⃣ Data Preparation (SQL)
- Raw transaction data cleaned and normalized
- Product, date, payment, and pricing layers modeled
- Reporting-ready tables created

### 2️⃣ Business Logic & Simulation (Power BI & DAX)
- Dynamic USD/TRY exchange rate simulation
- Daily price anomaly detection
- Payment-method-based purchasing behavior analysis
- Product line operational volume tracking

### 3️⃣ Decision-Oriented Dashboard Design
- Executive-friendly KPI hierarchy
- Risk-focused visual prioritization
- Fast identification of loss-making areas

## 📊 Key Insights Generated

🔎 Certain product groups drop up to **80% below normal price levels** on specific days → *Hidden profit leakage*  

💳 Credit card transactions show **up to 40% higher basket size**  

💱 FX simulation reveals **margin breakpoints under currency volatility**  

📉 Some campaigns increase sales volume while **reducing overall profitability**

## 🧩 Dashboard Outcome

This dashboard no longer answers:
> "What happened?"

It answers:
